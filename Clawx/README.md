This is Clawx, a lox bytecode implementation. LoxSharp was my c# representation, using chapters 1-11 of *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom.
C# was chosen because it is the language I use for work, and is close enough to the jlox interpretation that I could easily follow along, but couldnt turn my brain off to copy and paste code snippits. 
For the bytecode representation, I wanted to challenge myself by using Rust, trendy and cool language that I have never used before outside of a single Leetcode easy question. If the code is bad, this is my excuse. I am intentionally going a little over my head in order to learn both about compilers and implementing them, as well as the rust language in general, at the same time.
